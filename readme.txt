Pledge:
On my honor I have neither given nor received aid on this
exam.

The .ipynb files are source codes.
The .pdf file is where all my answers are.
There are several sub-questions to parts 1 and 2. Even though the questions are marked
separately, I felt the answers are related hence I do not necessarily have separate
paragraph of answers for separate questions within a single part. Rather I have divided
my paragraphs as a single set of thoughts. Even though they are structured in that way
I have answered all the questions. Paragraphs which contain answers to multiple questions
are marked in bold. So please keep that in mind.

Even though I have embedded the graphs in the pdf file, I have included the .png files
in the zip folder as well.
